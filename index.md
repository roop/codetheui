This is a book about developing for iOS by creating the UI
programmatically, rather than using Interface Builder.

I'm just starting out on writing this book, so there isn't much content
yet.

If you're an iOS developer who wants to learn how to create the UI in
code, I'd love to hear your thoughts on what you want to see in this
book.

If you're an iOS developer who already creates the UI in code, it would
be great to know your comments on the outline and whatever content is
up so far.

You can contact me by [email](mailto:roop@roopc.net) or on
