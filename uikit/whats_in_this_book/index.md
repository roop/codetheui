# What's in this book

Being able to create the UI in code is a useful skill to have in an iOS
developer's toolbox, but Apple's API documentation and guides lean
heavily towards using Interface Builder. This book, a primer on creating
the UI programmatically, tries to make it easier to acquire this skill.

To be able to read this book you should:

  - Be able to read and understand Swift code
  - Be able to use Xcode for writing, building and running code

If you're new to iOS development, this book might be a little
overwhelming because it spends no time introducing Swift and Xcode.
Therefore, I suggest you read this book alongside another book or
tutorial on getting starting with iOS programming.

If you're already into iOS (or macOS) development, you will be able to
follow along comfortably.
